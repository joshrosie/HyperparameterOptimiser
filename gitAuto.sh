#This script also performs a database dump. The name of the container (i.e. mysql-db) shouldn't change.
#Note: The hyperopt database will be dumped into two places. Namely sclscripts and dbBackups. 
#Both sclscripts and dbBackups are in our git repo.
#sclscripts has the file <hyperopt.sql> which is our "most-up-to-date" hyperopt DB.
#dbBackups stores all the incremental backups made. This allows for us to have a contingency plan incase
#anything goes wrong and we need to restore our database from an older, healthy version.

#The following dumps hyperopt db stored on your local volume into shared folder (accessed from git repo).
# i.e. This overwrites sqlscripts/hyperopt.sql with your local version of the hyperopt db.
